# Mammoth
Mammoth is the infantile-stage of a decenturalized social platform, integrating Web3 technology. Our goal is to create a platform that is free from centralized control, allowing users to curate their content based on personal interests. Moving away from algorithms that prioritize content for engagement metrics, Mammoth empowers users to see what genuinely interests them, fostering a truly user-centric and personalized experience. 

The inspiration of this project are majority from Mastodon and RSS Feeds.


This is a 36-hr project created at HackUMass VI.
