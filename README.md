# Lyuba.tech
Lyuba is the infantile-stage of a decenturalized social platform, integrating Web3 technology. Our goal is to create a platform that is free from centralized control, allowing users to curate their content based on personal interests. Moving away from algorithms that prioritize content for engagement metrics, Lyuba empowers users to see what genuinely interests them, fostering a truly user-centric and personalized experience. 

The inspiration of this project are majority from Mastodon and RSS Feeds.

This is a 36-hr project created at HackUMass VI.

## Name
Lyuba is the name of the best preserved Mammoth baby, from c. 41,800 years ago at the age of 30-35 days. 
Mammoth is a close relative to a mastodon, and our project is a baby version of what it could grow up to be.
Mammoths are the closest cousins to Mastodon. 

## Motivation
To begin, we believe individuals should be able to control their data and have full transparency with their data records. No private entities should be able to monopolize social networks.

With the rise of media dependency, social media has slowly becoming less and less social. User's personal feed is often filled with suggested posts from an algorithm that aims to show posts that keep one scrolling for as long as possible. In a way, *social* media is no longer socializing. This is partially fueled by the fact that social media companies owns the server that host this social network and they then in terms could profit by keeping its users on their network for long. Not only does these private entities owns the server(s), they also can easily take user data without any overseers and train the suggestion algorithm with them. 
After looking into Mastodon, a free and open-source decentralized social media released in 2016. We believe there are some downside to Mastodon that may be affecting its general popularity. 
- users may want to receive updates (posts) from creators that they previously follow and want to keep up to in some centralized sociao media
- user has no motivation to host individual servers on their machine

The somewhat recent update to Instagram that pushed suggested posts into user's personal feed, crowding up the user's feed which used to only be for one's followed list, and making it so that one's home feed will virtually never end, turning one's "checking on update from friend's lives" to a long scrolling session, and sometimes not even finding the posts from the people you follow and wanted to see. We believe users should be able to see what they actually wanted to see when they are checking their social media instead of being distracted by an endless pit of memes before even seeing the content one logged on to view. 

## How will Lyuba differ
- Lyuba will be a completely individualized platform, whereas Mastodon is more of a network of many smaller centralized servers, we want Lyuba to be as decentralized as possible
- Lyuba will allow users to curate their feed free of any private suggestion algorithms
- Lyuba allows users to have full transparency with how their data is stored and used, and full control over what their data can/will be used for
- Because servers are individualized, no private entity may restrict access to the data that is publicly accessible
- In addition to content posted directly on Lyuba, the subscription feed (RSS-like) allows user to view contents from centralized platforms without switching
