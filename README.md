# Lyuba.tech
Lyuba is the infantile-stage of a decenturalized social platform, integrating Web3 technology. Our goal is to create a platform that is free from centralized control, allowing users to curate their content based on personal interests. Moving away from algorithms that prioritize content for engagement metrics, Lyuba empowers users to see what genuinely interests them, fostering a truly user-centric and personalized experience. 

The inspiration of this project are majority from Mastodon and RSS Feeds.


This is a 36-hr project created at HackUMass VI.

## Name
Lyuba is the name of the best preserved Mammoth baby, from c. 41,800 years ago at the age of 30-35 days. 
Mammoth is a close relative to a mastodon, and our project is a baby version of what it could grow up to be.
